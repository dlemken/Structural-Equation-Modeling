# Structural-Equation-Modeling
I produced a recap with the basics of structural equation modelling. Please find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k98X60lF1ew

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is a powerful technique to model complex relationships. SEM can be applied to a broad range of research fields. The conceptual ideas behind SEM can be confusing because they are derived from multiple research fields.   The video is a beginner course on the concepts involved in SEM. It briefly introduces the basics of how to conceptualize a relationship between Variables. It explains the advantages of SEM in modeling a variety of conceptualized relationships. And the video is a practical guide on how to assess measurement models and structural relationships. An empirical example from our research at University of GÃ¶ttingen is presented. You will be enabled to use SEM for own purposes.  Cheers,  Dominic Lemken
